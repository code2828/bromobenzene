for each station:
```
@serial number
identifier
number of distinct directions
[directions]
[compatibility of directions]
``` where [directions] = a list of directions

for each direction:
```
serial number
line name
next station's number and direction
distance
```

distance == -1 signifies a ternimal

[compatibility of directions]: a table of n*n, where n = number of directions
element = 0  ->  not accesible from row to column
element = 1  ->  good
element = 2  ->  row can go to column but needs turning around
element = 3  ->  row can go to column but needs other ways to do so
element = 9  ->  at least one of the two directions is ternimal.
